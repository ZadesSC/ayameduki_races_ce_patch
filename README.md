# Ayameduki Race Patches for Combat Extended

## Overview
This mod patches Ayameduki race mods to work seamlessly with **Combat Extended (CE)**, covering cases where:
- CE's built-in patches are missing content.
- Specific items, weapons, or apparel were not patched correctly.

Simply load this mod **after the Ayameduki mods** in your load order.

I originally created this for personal use but decided to share it with the community. While not extensively tested for every item and race, it functions well enough in my games. Some late-game stats might be a bit overpowered (*looking at you, Idearn*).

If you encounter any issues or missing patches, feel free to report them! I may or may not address them, depending on time and priority.
